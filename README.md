### How Cheaters Exploit These Bugs

Cheaters use the above bugs in the following ways:
- **Map Hacking Exploit:** Reveals enemy units and strategies by displaying the entire map.
- **Commander Exploit:** Grants access to powerful commanders that are not available to the player legitimately.
- **Drop Hack Exploit:** Disconnects opponents from the game, unfairly awarding a win to the cheater.
